- **Personalization Engine**: Learns from user preferences and interaction history
- **Confidence Metrics**: Provides AI confidence scores for each recommendation
- **Ranking System**: Intelligent sorting based on multiple AI factors

### 2. **Style Analysis & Intelligence**
- **Style Confidence Analysis**: AI evaluates how well your chosen style matches your preferences
- **Occasion Matching**: Smart analysis of appropriateness for different events
- **Seasonal Intelligence**: Weather and seasonal appropriateness scoring
- **Trend Alignment**: Real-time fashion trend relevance assessment

### 3. **User Preference Learning**
- **Interaction History**: Tracks user selections and feedback
- **Preference Learning**: Adapts recommendations based on user behavior
- **Personalization Bonus**: Calculates personalized scoring based on user preferences
- **Continuous Improvement**: System gets smarter with each interaction

### 4. **Trend Analysis Engine**
- **Seasonal Trends**: Real-time analysis of current fashion movements
- **Trend Scoring**: Each recommendation includes trend relevance scores
- **Dynamic Updates**: Trends automatically update based on season selection
- **Fashion Intelligence**: Incorporates current style movements into recommendations

## 🧠 AI Algorithms Implemented

### **Recommendation Scoring Algorithm**
```javascript
// Multi-factor scoring system
finalScore = (aiScore * 0.7) + (personalizationBonus * 0.3)

// Where aiScore combines:
aiScore = (score * 0.4) + (confidence * 0.3) + (trendScore * 0.3)
```

### **Personalization Bonus Calculation**
```javascript
// Base bonus with preference matching
let bonus = 0.5;

// Color preference matching
if (item.includes(userColorPreference)) bonus += 0.1;

// Fit preference matching
if (userPrefersLoose && item.includes('Oversized')) bonus += 0.2;

// Brand preference matching
if (item.brand === userBrandPreference) bonus += 0.15;
```

### **Style Analysis Algorithm**
```javascript
// Weighted analysis scoring
overallScore = (
  styleConfidence * 0.3 +
  occasionMatch * 0.3 +
  seasonalAppropriateness * 0.2 +
  trendAlignment * 0.2
);
```
